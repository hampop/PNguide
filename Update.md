=======================================
 
And now a pause for a while, as I want to sort out a collection of Araucaria-type trees and it'll take a while.

Addition of a global biome blacklist in the config

THERE IS NO NEED TO UPDATE TO THIS VERSION UNLESS YOU REQUIRE THAT BIOME BLACKLIST FACILITY!

Tweak to Magnolia wood/plank textures so it joins up

Bug-fix so that trees' expanded bases can replace snow layers, etc.

Addition of Bunya and Columnar Araucaria trees, and Bunya fruit-drop mechanism.
Improvement of Monkey Puzzle Araucaria leaf texture and slight reduction of leaf density on that tree.

Adding some logic to Nelumbo so it will re-sprout from underwater if the top is iced-over
