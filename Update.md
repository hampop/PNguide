# 8.1 
Addition of a global biome blacklist in the config

THERE IS NO NEED TO UPDATE TO THIS VERSION UNLESS YOU REQUIRE THAT BIOME BLACKLIST FACILITY!

Whoops, sorry - addition of missing spore-bearing organs to Bothrodendron 

# 10.0 
Addition of Ginkgo tree - may require a tweak to improve "bushiness" in due course

Tweak to Magnolia wood/plank textures so it joins up

Bug-fix so that trees' expanded bases can replace snow layers, etc.

Make a lower limit for height of Ginkgoes at 10 blocks (they were generating at stupidly small heights)

Further darkening of redwood textures

Addition of Agathis tree

Bugfix to ensure that breaking logs sets off leaf-decay properly.
Addition of Bunya and Columnar Araucaria trees, and Bunya fruit-drop mechanism.
Improvement of Monkey Puzzle Araucaria leaf texture and slight reduction of leaf density on that tree.
Hiding of Monkey Puzzle fruit concept for the moment: those trees only drop saplings again for now.
Tweaks to default biome-requirements for a few trees.
Addition of biome overrides for tree generation in the config.
