# update 
list 3.0 -> 57.0.2 


# 3.0 
An overhaul to fix some kind of internal corruption, but with no additional features apart from a slightly more useful config file to manage natural spawns.

***** read the main description page to see a warning and more info about this update ***** 


# 4.0 
Introduction of Glossopteris tree
==== UPDATE YOUR CONFIG FILE! ===== 

# 4.5 
Bug fix to correct possible risk of world-gen freezes for natural spawns and false-positives for world leaks

Added Glossopteris bush spawns via the config

# 5.0 
Added Liriodendron (tulip trees) 


# 6.0 
Introduction of Magnolia

Slight bug fix to prevent saplings sometimes vanishing instead of growing

Improved finish to leaf textures 


# 7.0 
Added Redwood trees

Added spore-bearing organs to Lepidodendron

A few minor bugfixes and tweaks to other stuff


# 7.1 
Very minor tweak to the vibrancy of redwood colours - they are now less garish


# 8.0 
Addition of Wollemia trees

Slight improvement to Magnolia generation code

=======================================
 
And now a pause for a while, as I want to sort out a collection of Araucaria-type trees and it'll take a while. 

# 8.1 
Addition of a global biome blacklist in the config

THERE IS NO NEED TO UPDATE TO THIS VERSION UNLESS YOU REQUIRE THAT BIOME BLACKLIST FACILITY! 

# 9.0 
Addition of Bothrodendron and Diaphorodendron

And now I really MUST pause while I work on big, complex Araucaria-types......... 

# 9.1 
Whoops, sorry - addition of missing spore-bearing organs to Bothrodendron 

# 10.0 
Addition of Ginkgo tree - may require a tweak to improve "bushiness" in due course

Darkening of redwood textures

Tweak to Magnolia wood/plank textures so it joins up

Bug-fix so that trees' expanded bases can replace snow layers, etc. 

# 10.1 
Make a lower limit for height of Ginkgoes at 10 blocks (they were generating at stupidly small heights)
