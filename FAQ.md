## FAQ 

## 1) How do I build a portal to a dimension?
Portals are built in the same way as Nether portals, from these blocks:
Precambrian: Stromatolite
Cambrian: Sponge
Ordovician: Coral Reef
Silurian: Prototaxites block
Devonian: Archaeopteris planks
Carboniferous: Calamites Plant Fibre Block
Permian: Glossopteris planks
Triassic: Dicroidium fremouwense planks

You open a portal with the bone wand with the Enchantment of Time Reversal on it.

## 2) How do I make a Stromatolite or Reef portal?
Use something sticky on the blocks (or any fallable block!) to hold them in place.

## 3) How do I spawn the creatures in the overworld?
For v.51 of the mod and onwards the bespoke spawner in the config will allow you to define any spawns you like in any biome you like.

## 4) How do I have mobs from other mods included in the natural spawns?
If the other mod is Fossils and Archeology or Jurassic World Reborn then there is a specific setting in the Prehistoric Nature config which you can switch to "true" to include default spawns for their mobs in the right places. For other mods, you will need to define your own spawns - see 3)

## 5) How do I bring prehistoric creatures out of the dimensions?
Use cages, buckets or glass jars. If the mobs are too big to fit, you will need to breed them to get a smaller baby. Or just take their eggs with you instead. Other modded mob-catching solutions will also work. 

## 6) How do I get prehistoric plants?
Check the in-game Palaeopedia for the revival system.

## 7) How do I stop blocks or mobs from some-other-mod from generating in the prehistoric dimensions?
- Fist check the other mod's config to see if you can blacklist the prehistoric dimensions (-78, -79, -80, -81, -82, -83, -84, -85, -86).
- If you still need to block mobs, use InControl, and check Curseforge page for Prehistoric Nature for a sample config for that.
- If you still need to prevent certain blocks from generating in the dimensions, you are out of luck here: beg, cajole and complain at the other mod's authors as it's up to them to manage what their mod does.

## 8) How do I get resin?
Resin can be extracted from these trees using the resin extractor machine pushed up against them, by default, but you can configure this in the mod's config file if you wanted to:

Minecraft: Spruce
Prehistoric Nature: Hymenaea
Prehistoric Nature: Agathis
Prehistoric Nature: Araucarioxylon
Prehistoric Nature: Bunya Araucaria
Prehistoric Nature: Columnar Araucaria
Prehistoric Nature: Monkey Puzzle Araucaria
Prehistoric Nature: Bushy Araucaria
Prehistoric Nature: Sparse Araucaria
Prehistoric Nature: Tall Araucaria
Prehistoric Nature: Sciadopitys
Prehistoric Nature: Wollemi Pine
Prehistoric Nature: Scrubby Pine
Prehistoric Nature: Stunted Pine
Prehistoric Nature: Cunninghamia
BiomesOPlenty: Fir
BiomesOPlenty: Pine
Jurassicraft / Jurassic World Reborn: Araucaria
Wild Nature: Cedar
Wild Nature: Fir
Wild Nature: Pine 

## 9) What will the future be for this mod?
We will be adding dimensions for Jurassic, Cretaceous, Paleogene, Neogene and Pleistocene, and there will highly likely be knock-on effects in a little bit of overworld generation. The mod will include all the famous creatures and plants and everything you'd expect for all time periods, so no need to wonder if some extremely famous dinosaur will be in the mod, or whether we are doing the Cenozoic. The answer is yes. While we intend to complete the mod in 1.12.2, we also will be porting the mod to a more modern Minecraft version as well, but don't expect that any time extremely soon.
