Introduction : This mod adds the entire prehistoric natural ecology to Minecraft. The main gameplay is to resurrect or capture prehistoric creatures. At the same time, you can make biological specimens and explore prehistoric dimensions. Including hundreds of accurate prehistoric animals and plants, you can download individual dimension mods to explore beautiful, unique multi-biotic prehistoric dimensions, each with precise details representing different periods of Earth's prehistory. This mod builds everything after in-depth research using the latest scientific publications, and the team includes paleontology professionals to ensure the models, textures and behaviors are as accurate as possible.
